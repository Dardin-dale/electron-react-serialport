# electron-react-serialport

This was intended to be a boiler plate for an electron app template that works along with the node-serialport library.
Currently, this needs a recompiled version of the node-serialport library that works with both Electron and React. 
Electron-Rebuilder seems to have issues importing the node-serialport library along with other "native" packages. 

A future boilerplate will be posted using the Proton Native framework that should work for smaller desktop applications that need
serialport access.
